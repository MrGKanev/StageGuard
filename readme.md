## Installation

1. Upload the `stageguard` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings > StageGuard to configure the plugin.

## Configuration

1. **Debug Mode**: Toggle WordPress debug mode on or off.
2. **Password Protection**: Enable to redirect non-logged-in users to the WordPress login page.
3. **IP Restriction**: Enable and specify allowed IP addresses to restrict access to the staging site.
4. **Allowed IPs**: Enter the IP addresses that should have access to the staging site (one per line).

## Viewing Logs

You can view the StageGuard logs in two ways:

1. **Admin Interface**: Go to Settings > StageGuard Logs in the WordPress admin area.
2. **WP-CLI**: Use the command `wp stageguard show_log` to view logs in the terminal.

## WP-CLI Commands

StageGuard supports the following WP-CLI commands:

- `wp stageguard debug_mode <on|off>`: Toggle debug mode on or off.
- `wp stageguard show_log [--lines=<number>]`: Display the StageGuard log. Use the `--lines` option to specify the number of lines to show (default is 50).

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with StageGuard, check the following:

1. Ensure that the web server has write permissions to the `wp-content` directory for logging.
2. If you're not seeing the staging indicator, check if your theme is properly loading the `wp_head` action.
3. If password protection isn't working, make sure you're not already logged in to WordPress.
